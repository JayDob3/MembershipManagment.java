# MembershipManagment.java

I read the book "Learn Java in one day and LEARN IT WELL" by Jamie Chan.

After finishing school, I read this book to brush up on my knowledge. Once done, I decided to code the membership management program at thee back of the book and have successfully got the program to run as it was designed to.
